# Introduction

A demo application I built that initially was a port of the PureMVC version to learn 
how to use the Swiz framework. The same updates have been made here so the app will 
compile against the latest Flex SDK release (4.5.1).

I'll be making more updates to learn how to use the presentation model which in turn 
will allow me to do unit testing. I started learning how to unit testing recently in 
Ruby and have been applying that back into my Flex work.

# Setup

Once the project is cloned locally just import it as a Flash Builder project into a 
workspace. You don't have to change any settings as long as its running against 
Flex 4.5.1. Make sure to right click on the ContactManager.mxml file and select 
"Set as Default Application" if it's not already the default. Run the AIR app.
