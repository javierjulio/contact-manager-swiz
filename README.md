A demo application that is a port of the PureMVC version I built but using the Swiz 
framework instead. The same component updates have been made here too so everything 
will run against the latest Flex SDK release which as of this writing is 4.5.1.

Once the project is cloned locally just import it as a Flash Builder project into a 
workspace. You don't have to change any settings as long as its running against 
Flex 4.5.1. Make sure to right click on the ContactManager.mxml file and select 
"Set as Default Application" if not already the default.
